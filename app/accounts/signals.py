"""
Well, the signals are the utilities or feature that helps us 
to connect the events with the actions.
So this simply means that signals are used to perform some actions 
on every modification or creation
of a particular entry in the database.

So the most common use cases of using signal is to automatically 
creating a profile instance as soon as the user is created.

About Receiver and Sender:

Receiver is a function, in this case: post_save_create_profile_receiver, 
it takes 4 parameters:
- sender (CustomeUser),
- instance (that is something created by CustomeUser),
- created (a boolean value, will show up when something is created), and
- **kwargs.
Sender is the CustomeUser model itself.

    So as soon as the user is created, 
    or as soon as we get the response of created equal to true, 
    then what we need to do, we need to actually create the user profile.

    Steps:
    1. Check created flag is being true or false.
    2. If it is true, then create UserProfile

        '''
        1. If User profile is updated, then 'created' is false.
        2. Create User profile and save it.
        3. Jika User profile dihapus, kemudian user di-update, akan error.
        4. Gunakan try block untuk menghindari situasi ini.
